# permissions.yml - Example for PaperMC 1.21.5
# This file is rarely used. LuckPerms is the recommended way to manage permissions.

groups:
  default:
    # Default group for all players.
    permissions:
      - essentials.help   # Allows use of /help
      - essentials.spawn  # Allows use of /spawn

  moderator:
    # Moderators get additional permissions.
    permissions:
      - essentials.kick   # Allows kicking players
    inheritance:
      - default           # Inherits all permissions from the default group

  admin:
    # Admins have full access.
    permissions:
      - '*'               # Grants all permissions (not always reliable)
    inheritance:
      - moderator         # Inherits all permissions from the moderator group

users:
  # Specific players can be assigned to groups manually.
  # Replace "player-uuid" with the actual UUID of a player.
  "player-uuid":
    group: admin          # Assigns this player to the admin group
    permissions:
      - essentials.fly    # Grants permission to use /fly

# Reminder:
# - This file has very limited functionality.
# - Use LuckPerms for better permission management.
# - Some plugins may not support this system.
